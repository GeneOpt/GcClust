Description: GcClust is a software package for statistical clustering of
    regional geochemical data, and similar data such as regional mineralogical
    data. The clustering procedure partitions the field samples for a data set
    into two clusters. Each cluster is partitioned again to create two
    sub-clusters, and so on, generating a hierarchy of clusters.
    The clustering method is based on a
    Bayesian finite mixture model. The model parameters are estimated with
    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the posterior probability density
    function.
